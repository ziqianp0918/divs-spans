# DIVs and SPANs
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using_ `<div>` _and_ `<span>` _elements in their proper syntax._

## Before you begin
Observe the files in this repo:  

* `index.html` is where you will be doing your coding.
* `README.md` is the file you're reading.  You should be reading it on GitHub.
* `result.png` is the result you should be aiming for with `index.html`.
* `style.css` is the styling that will make `index.html` look pretty.  You're welcome.

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repo.
* Wrap all content inside `body` with a `div` with attribute `class="wrapper"`.  
  * Don't forget to add a `</div>` at the end (right before `</body>`).
* Wrap all similarities with a `div` with attribute `class="similarities"`.  
* Wrap all differences with a `div` with attribute `class="differences"`.  
* Wrap the words **containers**, **block**, and **inline** with _their own_ `span`s with attribute `class="blue"`.
* When you are finished, the preview should look like `result.png`.
* Mirror your `master` branch with a `gh-pages` branch and `push`.
* If you finish early, add a section to the bottom with links to helpful resources for learning more about `<div>`s and `<span>`s.

Good luck!
